    <h2>Fuzzy Translation</h2>
    <p>
      Fuzzy entries, even if they account for translated entries for most other
      purposes, usually call for revision by the translator. Those may be
      produced when updating from older translated PO files according to a new
      PO template file, such that some new <tt>msgid</tt> has been modified only
      slightly out of an older one. The slight alteration in the original string
      (the <tt>msgid</tt> string) should often be reflected in the translated
      string, and this requires the intervention of the translator.

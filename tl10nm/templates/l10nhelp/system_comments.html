    <h2>System Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments which are <em>extracted</em> from the <tt>source-code</tt> by the
      extraction tools.</p>
    <p>Usualy this are used to let the translator know something. Consider the
      following example:</p>
    <pre>#: No need to translate the application name
_('My Application')</pre>
    <p>This tells the translator that there's no need to translate that message,
      it's the application name <em>(this is just an example)</em>.</p>
